# Group project

Main Page: Travel Blog

Filter: Five Continents
Search Function: Set up a database
User Registration: Email, username, password

Blog Form: Title, state, date, content

Comment Section (canceled): Username, content

Tools:
HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, XAMPP, database

Currently, I’ve added relevant pages. For now, I’m using HTML to design the layout because PHP files cannot be directly previewed on the server. Once the structure is mostly complete, I will rename the files to .php.

Plan in 11/15:
Main Pages:
index.html
blog.html
login.html
sign.html
edit.html
newblog.html
Additional Includes:

header.php
footer.php
The delete function will be triggered by JavaScript.
Edit and delete icons will only be visible after logging in.
