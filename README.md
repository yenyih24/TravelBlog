# Travel Blog Project

A simple travel blog website with functionality for filtering, user registration, and blog management.

## Features
- **Main Page**: Displays travel blogs with a filter for five continents.
- **Search Function**: Integrates a database to support content filtering.
- **User Registration**: Users can register with their email, username, and password.
- **Blog Form**: Allows users to create blogs with the following fields:
  - Title
  - State
  - Date
  - Content
- **Comment Section**: Initially planned but canceled.
- **Edit & Delete Functions**: 
  - Delete triggered via JavaScript.
  - Edit/Delete icons visible only after logging in.

## Tools & Technology
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: Managed with XAMPP (Apache, MySQL)
- **Development Environment**: XAMPP for local server setup.

## Current Progress
- Relevant pages have been created using HTML:
  - `index.html`
  - `blog.html`
  - `login.html`
  - `sign.html`
  - `edit.html`
  - `newblog.html`
- Pages are being designed with HTML for layout testing, as PHP files cannot be directly previewed on some servers. Once the structure is finalized, files will be converted to `.php`.

## Plan (as of 11/15)
- **Main Pages**:
  - `index.html`
  - `blog.html`
  - `login.html`
  - `sign.html`
  - `edit.html`
  - `newblog.html`
- **Additional Includes**:
  - `header.php`
  - `footer.php`

## Future Improvements
- Complete backend integration with PHP and MySQL.
- Finalize the edit and delete functionalities for logged-in users.
- Enhance responsiveness and styling.
